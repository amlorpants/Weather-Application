this is my module 6 repo

## Description

This challenge required me to create a weather app. I had to use two API's one for gathering lat lon data and one to catch that data to use for named cities. I had to create a search bar that, upon click, generates that cities weekly weather data. In each card there are the same items, city name, date, temp, wind, humidity and an icon.
